Hammerfest [![Status Zero][status-zero]][andivionian-status-classifier]
==========

Hammerfest is a project to implement a lobby server for [Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath][cnc3].

Implementation Status
---------------------

Wew are on the stage when the game is able to show the login screen.

Overall, we are still more at the exploration stage; scope of work is to be determined.

Visit [the issue tracker][issues] if you want to know more.

Usage
-----

Currently Hammerfest is only suitable for development mode, and only on Windows.

**âš  For now, the administrator privileges are required to run the server, since it modifies the system `hosts` file.**

To start the server:

```console
# dotnet run --project Hammerfest.Server
```

It reads the configuration from the `appsettings.json` file.

The server performs the following operations:
- Temporarily overrides the contents of `%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file, adding the server host to it.

  Pass `false` in the `Dns.Enable` configuration file if this is unwanted.
- Starts a ServServ HTTP implementation on port `80`.

Press `Ctrl+C` to terminate the server.
